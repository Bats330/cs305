Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements.
Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address

The client that I was working with throughout this project
was Artemis Finacial which was a financial institution looking
looking to add some additional security practices into there 
existing program.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? 
Why is it important to code securely? 
What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being

I felt like the things I did well when finding vulnerabilities
in the clients software would have to be identifying what 
the vulnerability was and why it was getting flagged while also
finding a solution to fixing that issue or atleast delivering a
resolution on what can be changed to fix it. software security adds 
alot to the company as they are wanting to provide their clients
with a safe and secure practice and protect all information
from malicious attacks.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

some parts of the vulnerability assessment that was hard to me was having
to go through the various cve codes and determine where false positives
were being thrown.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, 
what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide 
which mitigation techniques to use?

when looking at the layers of vulnerability that was inline
with the clients program alot of the issues could simply be fixed by
updating the libraries.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional
and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether 
you introduced new vulnerabilities?

through running multiple software debugging and insuring
a secure connection on the connection side of things to prevent 
any vulnerabilities there. While also running vulnerability checks
to make sure I was not introducing new vulnerabilities.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional 
and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether 
you introduced new vulnerabilities?

A resource that I used quite often was stack overflow
as it typically had other people who may have ran
into the same sort of issues or at least similar to
what I was running into allowing for some guidance towards
a solution.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully
completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What 
from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would have to say my use of has functions in which I used to deliver
encrypted communications.
